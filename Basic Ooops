Certain Object Oriented Concepts for LinkedList
1. What is a class?
Ans: Blueprint/Template of an object, or else a structure 
which has all the logical information(name, age, section, marks...etc) for an entity(Student)
at one place. 
class Student{
    String name;
    Integer age;
    String section;
}
Object of Student class. 

2. What is an object of class?
In class we have all the logical information that we require at one place.
Using object I can create as many instances of the class as much as I want.
Student st = new Student(); st is the instance
st.name = "Rahul"
Student st2 = new Student();
st2.name = "Raj"
System.out.prinln(st.name); //"Rahul"
Student[] students = new Student[1000];
students[i].name;

Which helps me to access all the information for that object.

3. What is a static variable, and static method?
4. What is a constructor?
Ans: It allocates memory for the object and also intialises the object.

5. What is method overloading in Java?

class Student{
    public String name;
    public Integer age;
    public String section;
}

class Main{

    /*

    */

    public static void changeName(Student student){
        System.out.println(student);
        student.name = "Mohnish";
    }

    public static void main(String args[]){

        Student[] student = new Student[2];
        // Array of Objects
        //student[0] is one object
        //[null, null]
        student[0] = new Student();
        student[1] = new Student();
        //Student@6ff3c5b5 - Memory Address
        //Student@3764951d - Memory Address
        //It says that this memory should only be referred by Object of Student class
        // System.out.println(student[0]); //Object reference or in c++ pointer
        // System.out.println(student[1]);

        Student st = new Student();
        System.out.println(st);
        st.name = "Rahul";
        changeName(st);
        System.out.println(st.name);

    }
}
